IDEA: 
The main idea behind this project was to create a modern Web Resume using Html, Css and javascript.
Different plugins were used to further make the resume more interactive and responsive.
Number of images were used to just give a litte extra touch.
Most of the code was done in html and css but some of the function such as water effect on the profile and all the animations were controlled using javascript.

Features and Special Animations:
Some animations were used to make app more attractive such as ;
1. If you hover the mouse over profile section you will see a special water effect.
2. You will see a bar with an animation in the profile section.
3. In Education and Skills section you will see the bars which indicates the experience in each fields, which will show animation everytime page is refreshed.
4. Also section below have animation which will show animation on every refresh.
5. In My Work section You will see image gallery which will show each section with its images and there is a slider used using library, which will auto function controlled by js.

Problems Faced:
There was some issues with the images as the gallery looks bit off that was because the intention was to put 3 images in one line but that could not be acheived
due to some reason and had to go with 2 images in one line which cuased some problems.
